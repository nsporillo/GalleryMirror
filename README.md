GalleryMirror is a imgur mirroring program. The purpose is to allow you to keep an always updated copy of a imgur gallery on your harddrive. This can be useful if you're someone who loves a particular type of image commonly found on imgur. Tag Galleries enable GalleryMirror to download every image by a tag.
